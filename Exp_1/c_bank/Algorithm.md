## Algorithm

1.  Set up the `MyBankApp` project with `Bank.java` and `Main.java`.
2.  Define account attributes and implement bank operation methods in `Bank.java`.
3.  In `Main.java`, import `Bank` and initialize `Scanner` and a `Bank` object.
4.  Display a welcome message to the user.
5.  Enter a loop to continuously display the main menu.
6.  Read the user's choice for a bank operation.
7.  Use a `switch` statement to call the corresponding bank method based on the choice.
8.  If the user chooses to exit, terminate the program.
9.  Handle invalid choices by printing an error message.
10. Continue the loop to redisplay the menu.
