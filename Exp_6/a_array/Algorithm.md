## Algorithm
1.  Define the **`Stack` class** with array **storage**, **maxSize**, and a **top index**.
2.	Implement capacity checks using `isEmpty()` and `isFull()`.
3.	Implement the `push()` operation to insert an element.
4.	Implement the `pop()` operation to remove and return the element at top.
5.	Implement the `peek()` operation to retrieve the element at top.
6.	Implement the `display()` operation to iterate and print elements.
7.	Instantiate the Stack object with a specified capacity in the main method.
8.	Perform Stack operations using the Stack object.
