## Algorithm
1.  Define the **`Stack` class** with array **storage**, **maxSize**, and a **top index**.
2.	Implement capacity checks using `isEmpty()` and `isFull()`.
3.	Implement the `push()` operation to insert an element.
4.	Implement the `pop()` operation to remove and return the element at top.
5.	Implement the `peek()` operation to retrieve the element at top.
6.	Implement the `display()` operation to iterate and print elements.
7.	Instantiate the Stack object with a specified capacity in the main method.
8.	Perform Stack operations using the Stack object.

## Program Output
```
10 pushed to stack.
20 pushed to stack.
30 pushed to stack.
Stack elements: 10 20 30
30 popped from stack.
Stack elements: 10 20
Top element: 20
40 pushed to stack.
50 pushed to stack.
60 pushed to stack.
Stack Overflow: Cannot push, stack is full.
Stack elements: 10 20 40 50 60
