## Algorithm
1.  Define a class named `Animal`.
2.  In the `Animal` class, define a public method `makeSound()` that prints "The animal makes a sound.".
3.  Define a class named `Dog` that extends `Animal`.
4.  In the `Dog` class, override the `makeSound()` method to print "The dog: Woof! Woof!".
5.  Define a class named `Cat` that extends `Animal`.
6.  In the `Cat` class, override the `makeSound()` method to print "The cat: Meow! Meow!".
7.  In the `Main` class's `main` method, declare an `Animal` reference `polymorphicDog` and assign it a new `Dog` object.
8.  Print "Polymorphic Dog: " and call `polymorphicDog.makeSound()`.
9. In the `Main` class's `main` method, declare an `Animal` reference `polymorphicCat` and assign it a new `Cat` object.
10. Print "Polymorphic Cat: " call `polymorphicCat.makeSound()`.

## Program Output
```
Polymorphic Dog: The dog: Woof! Woof!
Polymorphic Cat: The cat: Meow! Meow!
```
