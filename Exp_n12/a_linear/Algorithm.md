## Algorithm
1. Iteration: Start at the first element of the array.
2. Comparison: Check if the current element is equal to the target value.
3. Success: If a match is found, stop the search and return the index of that element.
4. Continuation: If there is no match, move to the next element and repeat the comparison.
5. Failure: If the end of the array is reached without finding a match, return a -1 to indicate failure.

## Program Output
```
Linear Search: Element found at index 5
